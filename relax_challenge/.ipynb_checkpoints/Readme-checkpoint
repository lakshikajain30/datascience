    "Using Random Forest, I can predict the adoption of users. To start, I loaded the takehome_users and takehome_user_engagement files. Labelled the users from the engagement data who have logged in at least 3 times in a 7 day period. These are the adopted users. Following to that, I merged the enagagement and users data. Used RandomForest to predict adoption and evaluated the models.Ended the project by displaying the importance of various features in predicting user adoption."
